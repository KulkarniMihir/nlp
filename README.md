## üìÇ **Machine Learning (Text Processing Techniques)**  
[Machine Learning Repository](https://github.com/KulkarniMihir/nlp/tree/main/machine_learning)

This section contains fundamental **text processing techniques** used in NLP, including:

- **Tokenization**: Dividing text into smaller units such as words or subwords.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" ‚Üí "run").
- **Lemmatization**: Converting words to their base form considering context.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities like people, locations, etc., within text.
- **TF-IDF**: A technique to measure the importance of words in a document relative to the whole corpus.
- **Word2Vec**: Representing words in continuous vector spaces, capturing their semantic meaning.

These techniques are essential for preprocessing and feature extraction in NLP tasks.

## üîÑ **Churn Prediction**  
[Churn Prediction Repository](https://github.com/KulkarniMihir/nlp/blob/main/churn_prediction/app.py)

This project predicts **customer churn** using machine learning models. The **`app.py`** file is the main implementation, which includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying relevant features influencing churn.
- **Model Training**: Using classification models in **ANN**  to predict churn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

This project helps businesses predict customer churn and enhance retention strategies.

## üß† **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Sentiment Analysis**  
[RNN Repository](https://github.com/KulkarniMihir/nlp/tree/main/RNN)

The **RNN** repository demonstrates **Sentiment Analysis** using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**. This project includes:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, padding, and vectorization of text data.
- **Model Architecture**: Building an RNN model using **RNN**.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Training the model to classify text into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

This project demonstrates the use of RNNs in analyzing sequential data for sentiment classification.

## üîÆ **Next Word Prediction with LSTM**  
[Next Word Prediction Repository](https://github.com/KulkarniMihir/nlp/tree/main/next_word_lstm)

The **Next Word Prediction** project uses **LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks)** to predict the next word in a given sequence. Key aspects of the project include:

- **Data Preparation**: Collecting and preprocessing text data.
- **Sequence Modeling**: Training an LSTM to predict the next word based on previous words.
- **Text Generation**: Generating text by predicting one word at a time.

LSTMs are particularly well-suited for sequential tasks like this, where understanding word dependencies over time is crucial.

## üåê **GenAI - Langchain Basics & Projects**  
[GenAI Repository](https://github.com/KulkarniMihir/nlp/tree/main/GenAI)

The **GenAI** repository introduces **Langchain**, a framework designed to build applications that leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This repository includes:

- **Langchain Basics**: Demonstrating how to chain multiple LLMs and external tools to solve complex NLP problems.
- **Langchain Projects**: Practical examples of a real-world use-cases developed using Langchain.

This repository serves as a valuable introduction to Langchain for building language-driven applications.
